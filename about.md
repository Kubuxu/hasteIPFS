** About **

This site is entirely based on http://hastebin.com

Currently it it supports only displaying already IPFS available files.

To display file just include its hash after a hash (#) in address bar
example: fs:/ipns/bin.ipfs.ovh/#QmNYLTVdHju9iFu7nDdmj91DJPhZiBdCxvgfatjLUHmq8z

or pass path to subsegment: 
Eexample: fs:/ipns/bin.ipfs.ovh/#QmatqCENPFEK4dqnitwz8RecFA5zNnaanqLPijCPHddb3V/helloworld.lua

You can also change highlighting by adding extension to file.
example: fs:/ipns/bin.ipfs.ovh/#QmNYLTVdHju9iFu7nDdmj91DJPhZiBdCxvgfatjLUHmq8z.c


Road map:
 * [x] Working with extension
 * [ ] Uploading files
 * [ ] Encryption of uploaded files
